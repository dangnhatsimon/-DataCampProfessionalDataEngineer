# Pods With Attached Storage
# List all available Storage Classes in the Kubernetes cluster using

# Apply the Manifest that declares your two Pods, 01_pods.yml
kubectl apply -f 01_pods.yml

# Observe the Pods' behavior.
kubectl get pods

# Apply the Manifest to declare the Persistent Volume Claim using the file 02_pvc.yml. This will create a PV dynamically, and attach it to the Pods
kubectl apply -f 02_pvc.yml

# Apply the manifests 01_pods.yml and 02_pvc.yml.
kubectl apply -f 01_pods.yml -f 02_pvc.yml

# check the status of your Persistent Volumes (PV).
kubectl get pv

# Let's find out which Pods are using this PV right now: use the command kubectl describe pv
c, 
# and pipe ("|") the output to the command grep "Used By" -B 3 -A 2 to get insights of your Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
# Your PVC is Used By: the two Pods datacamp-pod-1 and datacamp-pod-2.
kubectl describe pvc | grep "Used By" -B 3 -A 2
