# Scaling and Monitoring a Deployment
# Create your deployment using kubectl apply ... with the Manifest 01_first_manifest.yml
kubectl apply -f 01_first_manifest.yml

# Using kubectl, scale up the Deployment to 10 Pods.
# Remember (or check in the Manifest) that the name of your Deployment is "nginx-deployment"
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas 10

# Check that the 10 Pods have been created using kubectl get ... with the resource pods
# Note that each Pod has a unique, but random name.
kubectl get pods

# Using kubectl, scale down the Deployment to 3 Pods.
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas 3
