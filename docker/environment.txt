# The ARG Dockerfile instruction allows us to set a variable in a Dockerfile and then optionally override it when building an image. 
# We've added a Dockerfile to your current working directory with the following instructions:
FROM ubuntu
ARG WELCOME_TEXT=Hello!
RUN echo $WELCOME_TEXT
CMD echo $WELCOME_TEXT


docker build --build-arg WELCOME_TEXT=Welcome! .


# Changing behavior when starting a container
FROM ubuntu
ARG WELCOME_TEXT=Hello!
RUN echo $WELCOME_TEXT
CMD echo $WELCOME_TEXT
# Build the Dockerfile in your local working directory giving it the name hello_image
docker build -t hello_image .
# Start a container from the hello_image image you just made, but use a flag on the command to set the NAME ENV variable to your name
docker run --env NAME=hello_image hello_image
